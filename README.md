GSM based car theft control system

Forced breakout system
Accelerator control system

Input & Output:
Piezoelectric force sensor:
This sensor would detect any forceful activity over the car’s bonnet or door to either steal the engine or other spare parts or to just intrude in the car. If detected, a message will be sent through GSM to the user and the led will be on.

Ceramic piezoelectric sensor as vibration sensor:
This sensor would sense any force exerted above a given threshold on the car window to break it and get in. If detected, a message will be sent through GSM to the user and the LED will be on.

Automatic Accelerator Control System using relay:
If someone tries to use the car without the user's permission this system would break the accelerator's connection with the engine and stop the car. When the car starts, the user will be notified by message and the user will communicate back whether to break the accelerator connection to the engine or not through message ‘n/N’ or ‘y/Y’.

GSM:
It is used for communication between user and system.


The main application focused in this project is a secured theft control system for cars. But a similar system can be integrated for a home theft control system with various application of sensors and relay.

A piezo force sensor based system is capable of sensing the smallest force applied to it. Herein the owner can decide the threshold above which the system would become alert.

The relay based accelerator breakout system is capable of breaking the engine connection with the accelerator. This system would be helpful in the case where even if the thief is able to break in he won't be able to take the car away.

The limitations of the given application is that sometimes the system can give false alarm.

The specification limit of the given sensors can limit the wide application of the system
